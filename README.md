# The Center Feed

The center feed is an app designed for mobile use that displays current news from only center leaning, center-left leaning, and center-right leaning news organizations.  It does this by fetching the current news from [OkSurf News API](https://ok.surf/) and filtering it down to only the news organizations that are rated as center, center-left, or center-right by the [Political Bias Database](https://rapidapi.com/albertoescobar/api/political-bias-database).

Live app (designed for use on mobile): [centerfeed.org](https://www.centerfeed.com)
